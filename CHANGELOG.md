# Release Notes

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v2.0.4...HEAD)

## [v2.0.1](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) - 2024-10-03

### Changed

- Refactor `withBody` method in `ClientHandler` to only accept array arguments and encode given arguments to json string when called
- Update documentation and fix typos

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) - 2024-09-30

### Added

- **VitePress Documentation**: Introduced a new VitePress documentation site, including comprehensive API reference, examples, and guides. The site is accessible under the `./docs/` directory and deployable on Netlify.
- **Async Functionality**: Introduced a new async functionality using `async()` function powered by PHP Fibers for true asynchronous operations. This provides a modern, JavaScript-like `async/await` syntax for handling non-blocking requests.
- **Fluent API for HTTP Requests**: Added support for a fluent, chainable API inspired by Laravel’s HTTP client. Methods like `withHeaders()`, `withBody()`, `withToken()`, and others allow for more intuitive and flexible request building.
- **Task Lifecycle Management**: Introduced `Matrix`-powered task lifecycle management, allowing tasks to be paused, resumed, canceled, and retried for asynchronous requests.
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Added customizable retry logic for both synchronous and asynchronous requests, allowing for retries with exponential backoff in case of network failures.

### Changed

- **Refactor of `fetch()` Function**: Refactored the core `fetch()` function to support both synchronous and asynchronous requests seamlessly. Now supports direct chaining of promises with `then()` and `catch()` for async requests.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling to provide better control over exceptions during both sync and async requests. Introduced customizable error handlers and improved promise rejection management.
- **Response Class Overhaul**: The `Response` class has been revamped to better handle different response formats, including JSON, text, binary data (array buffer), and streams. This improves the handling of diverse response types.
- **Expanded Guzzle Configuration Options**: The package now exposes all of Guzzle’s configuration options directly via the `ClientHandler`, including proxy settings, cookies, redirects, and SSL certificates.

### Removed

- **Deprecated `fetchAsync` Method**: The `fetchAsync` function has been fully removed, replaced by the new `async()` helper function. This provides better async handling and aligns with the new architecture based on PHP Fibers.
- **Symfony `Response` Dependency**: Completely removed the dependency on Symfony’s `Response` class in favor of Guzzle’s PSR-7 compliant `Response` implementation. This reduces the package size and simplifies the dependencies.

### Fixed

- **Laravel 10 Compatibility Enhancements**: Improved compatibility with Laravel 10 and Symfony 6.x by resolving issues related to HTTP foundation conflicts. The package now supports a wider range of Symfony and Laravel versions without dependency clashes.
- **Async Error Handling**: Fixed issues with async request error handling, ensuring that promises are properly resolved or rejected with meaningful exception messages.
- **Persistent Guzzle Client Instances**: Fixed an issue where a new Guzzle client was instantiated for every request. The Guzzle client is now reused efficiently across both sync and async operations.

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v1.1.1...v1.2.0) - 2024-09-27

### Added

- **Guzzle PSR-7 Response Support**: Introduced the `guzzlehttp/psr7` library for managing HTTP responses, providing more flexibility and aligning with PSR-7 standards.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling for both synchronous and asynchronous requests using Guzzle's `RequestException`.
- **New README Documentation**: Updated the README to reflect the changes in response handling and usage of the `guzzlehttp/psr7` response.

### Changed

- **Refactor Response Class**: The `Response` class now extends `guzzlehttp/psr7\Response` instead of Symfony's `Response`, reducing dependency overhead and improving compatibility with PSR-7.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Refactored the `Http` class to ensure seamless request handling with the new `guzzlehttp/psr7` response model.
- **Removed Symfony Response Dependency**: Dropped Symfony's `Response` class in favor of the more lightweight and standard `guzzlehttp/psr7`.

### Fixed

- **Laravel 10 Compatibility**: Addressed compatibility issues with Laravel 10 by ensuring the package can work with Symfony 6.x versions while allowing flexibility for future upgrades.
- **Composer Dependency Conflicts**: Resolved conflicts with Symfony’s HTTP Foundation, ensuring compatibility for projects that depend on specific versions of Symfony and other packages.
- **Asynchronous Error Handling**: Fixed issues related to handling exceptions in asynchronous requests, ensuring proper error handling and promise resolution.

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) - 2024-09-25

### Changed

- **Updated Composer Dependencies:**
  The `symfony/http-foundation` dependency has been updated to support versions `^6.0 || ^7.0`, ensuring compatibility with Laravel 10 and future versions. This change allows smooth integration with Laravel 9.x, 10.x, and future Laravel versions without version conflicts.
- **Enhanced Test Suite for Compatibility:**
  The GitHub Actions test matrix has been expanded to test against Laravel 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x, ensuring future compatibility with new Laravel releases.

### Fixed

- **Compatibility Issue with Laravel 10:**
  The package had an installation conflict when used with Laravel 10 due to outdated `symfony/http-foundation` version constraints. This release resolves the issue, allowing users to install the package without dependency conflicts in Laravel 10 environments.

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/Thavarshan/fetch-php/compare/v1.1.4...v1.1.0) - 2024-09-24

### Changed

- **`Http` Class**: The HTTP request handling has been abstracted away into a new `Http` class, improving the overall structure of the library and allowing for cleaner, centralized management of requests via Guzzle.
- **Guzzle Client Reuse**: The Guzzle client is now instantiated as a singleton, meaning it is created once and reused across all HTTP requests. This change improves the performance of the library when making multiple requests.
- **Deprecation of `fetchAsync`**: The `fetchAsync` method is now deprecated in favor of `fetch_async`. A deprecation warning has been added to guide users to transition to the new method.

### Fixed

- **Guzzle Client Instantiation Issue**: Resolved an issue where the Guzzle client was instantiated for every HTTP request, leading to performance inefficiencies. Now, the client is reused across requests, reducing overhead.
