## The Modern HTTP Client for PHP

```php
// Quick API requests with fetch()
$response = fetch('https://api.example.com/users');
$users = $response->json();

// Or use HTTP method helpers
$user = post('https://api.example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com'
])->json();
```

### Flexible Authentication

```php
// Bearer token auth
$response = fetch('https://api.example.com/me', [
    'token' => 'your-oauth-token'
]);

// Basic auth
$response = fetch('https://api.example.com/private', [
    'auth' => ['username', 'password']
]);
```

### Powerful Async Support

```php
// Create promises for parallel requests
$usersPromise = fetch()->async()->get('https://api.example.com/users');
$postsPromise = fetch()->async()->get('https://api.example.com/posts');

// Wait for all to complete
fetch()->all(['users' => $usersPromise, 'posts' => $postsPromise])
    ->then(function ($results) {
        // Process results from both requests
        $users = $results['users']->json();
        $posts = $results['posts']->json();
    });
```

### Why Fetch PHP?

Fetch PHP brings the simplicity of JavaScript's fetch API to PHP, while adding powerful features like retry handling, promise-based asynchronous requests, and fluent interface for request building. It's designed to be both simple for beginners and powerful for advanced users.

### Getting Started

```bash
composer require jerome/fetch-php
```
